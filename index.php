            <li>This course has two pre-requisites: CSCI 107 and Art 142.</li>
            <li>It is assumed that students have been introduced to
HTML/CSS/JavaScript and have some proficiency in creating and editing digital graphics with Adobe Photoshop.</li>
            <li>The goal of this course is to expand upon and merge these skills to enable students to create original Web content.</li>
            <li>The course will culminate with students creating a high-quality Web page template using contemporary CSS
techniques and custom graphics.</li>
              <li>There are 6 graphics used in my course page (including background images) and the sum of the file sizes is 64K. My page is a not heavy download.</li>
              <li>I am using Server-Side Includes implemented with PHP so that all of my pages use a common Header/Footer.</li>
